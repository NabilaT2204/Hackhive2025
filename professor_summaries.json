The professor's positive impact on learning remains significant, though the accent will inevitably remain a challenge for some students.\n\nOverall, [professor name] excels in his teaching style and offers excellent support during office hours. While his English accent may be an obstacle, it does not detract from his ability to help students achieve academic success.
